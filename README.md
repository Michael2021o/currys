## üõí Currys Website Clone - Learning HTML & CSS üåü

Welcome to my Currys Website Clone project! This is a work-in-progress recreation of the Currys homepage, built using HTML and CSS . The primary goal of this project is to practice and solidify my understanding of front-end development concepts like semantic HTML, responsive design, and CSS layouts.
